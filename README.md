Benifiets:
- First alternative to be corecryptoless and independent from Apple Frameworks
- Super cross-platform and portable (even supports Linux !)
- CLI and GUI versions
- Paid developer accounts don't need a computer once Scarlet is installed
- Different codesigner (more stable than ldid/AltStore)
- Logic/handling of when to fetch anisette is entirely redesigned and understands when adi resets instantly
- Certificate re-use. Certificates aren't revoked when they don't have to be - the same certificate from the computer is shared to the phone if they have a matching teamID(account) and if still valid
- Certificates are directly checked with apple signing servers for the revokation status
